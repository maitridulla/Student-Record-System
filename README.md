# Student Record System

## Project Overview

The **Student Record System** is a simple Java-based desktop application designed to manage student records in schools and colleges. This application allows users to create, update, delete, and view student details such as personal information, attendance, and marks. The system supports two types of users: Admin and Student. 

Admins have the ability to manage student data, while students can view their own information. The project is structured using object-oriented programming principles and provides a streamlined interface for data management.
